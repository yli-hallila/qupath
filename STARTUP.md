QuPath v0.2.0-m4
==============

Welcome to QuPath v0.2.0-m4!

You can read more about what is different at https://qupath.github.io/

## Things you should know:
* This is a milestone release, not a finished version!
* You can use milestone releases to try out new features - but be aware that *the software is changing!*
* Data files and projects saved with this version might not be compatible with older versions (e.g. QuPath v0.1.2). It is *not* a good idea to mix them.
* Bio-Formats is included now by default - the old separate extension isn't needed (and isn't compatible).
* You can double-click this message to close it.

The final tip is a reward for people who read this message.
