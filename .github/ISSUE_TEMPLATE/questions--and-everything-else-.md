QuPath's 'Issues' section on GitHub is intended ONLY for bug reports, and NOT as a discussion forum.

**Help us keep things organized by posting questions & comments to https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath**

And, of course, check out the [documentation & tutorials](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/starting/index.html) to see if the information you need is already there.
